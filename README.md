# MLP_Backpropagation
Multi-layer perceptron with back-propagation implemented from scratch. Uses vectorized math to improve the speed of the calculations (compared to forloops). 

## Features
Some features are:
* 3 Layer design
* Parameter Tuning
* Batch size selection
* epoch selection
* Learning rate selection
* Hidden Layer Neuron Selection
